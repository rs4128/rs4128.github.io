### WORK EXPERIENCE


- Orenda Inc.	
  Data Science Intern	Jun 2021 - Sep 2021
  - Liaised with three members of the Data Science team to develop Deep Learning models to predict Real Time Prices in ERCOT.
  - Merged and Scraped data from various sources and performed Kendall, Pearson, ACF and PACF correlation for feature extraction.
  - Built a Stacked LSTM Categorical model that predicted the top three price peaks with an accuracy of approx 90 percent in Q2-Q3.
  - Finetuned the model hyperparameters  by trying various combinations and by using keras-tuner and keras-backend functions.

- Columbia University: School of Music, Arts and Sciences	
  Part Time Graduate Data Science Assistant	Feb 2021 - May 2021
  - Developed a data model to analyze the provenance and annotations in the print culture of the Mozarabic Rite in Europe.
  - Assisted in the organization of diverse data types sizing 6.7 GB (image files, PDF files) for interrelated history objects.

### PROJECTS


- **Lexical substitution with Word2Vec embeddings and BERT**	
  - Found Lexical substitutes by implementing Lesk Algorithm using Wordnet and BERT using Huggingface transformers.
  - Suggested a heuristic that involved use of synonyms that improved the performance of the BERT Transformer by 2%.

- **Exploratory Analysis and Visualization of Advanced NBA Stats**	
  - Developed a Bookdown project(using R)  that studied the impact COVID-19 had on player performance, the effect of Kobe Bryant’s death on the NBA fraternity, and a correlation between player injuries and positions.
  - Analyzed a comprehensive dataset with base statistics going back to 1980 and Advanced Statistics from 1990 onwards.

- **Machine Learning based Prediction of Earthquake Impact**
  - Predicted the impact of an earthquake and analysed for the best material to be used for buildings to mitigate its impact.
  - Adopted a novel parameter known as ‘Damage Grade’ to determine the extent of earthquake impact.
